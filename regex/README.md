# Regular Expressions

A series of JavaScript regular expression exercises backed by automated tests in Jest.

To run the test suite:

```shell
npm install
npm test
```

Each directory contains an `index.js` file that exports the relevant variables. Edit the regular expressions but don't change the variable names â€” the automated tests depend on the names being what they are.

Feel free to use tools like [Regexr][url-regexr] to test your regular expressions.
